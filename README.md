# Yle Areena embed for WordPress #

Yle Areena has no support for oEmbed in WordPress. So I made this plugin.

This WordPress plugin allows you to easily add Yle Areena videos to the site by simply copying their URL and pasting the URL into your content.

The same way as with Youtube and Vimeo URLs.

This can handle links like [https://areena.yle.fi/1-4477136](https://areena.yle.fi/1-4477136) and also in Swedish [https://arenan.yle.fi/1-3751167](https://arenan.yle.fi/1-3751167)

If the video is not allowed to be embedded (like [https://areena.yle.fi/1-1761713](https://areena.yle.fi/1-1761713), then a preview image is displayed and it links to the video on Yle Areena.

This plugin has no settings page.
